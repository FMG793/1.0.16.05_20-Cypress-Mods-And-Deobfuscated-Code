# Deobfuscation And Decompilation Tutorial

**Step 1**

Compile [RetroGuard](https://github.com/FMG793/RetroGuard-Modded) to a runable jar.

**Step 2**

Run [RetroGuard](https://github.com/FMG793/RetroGuard-Modded) in a console.
It will give you an instruction on how to use it.

**Step 3**

Run [RetroGuard](https://github.com/FMG793/RetroGuard-Modded) in a console with original Cypress client jar according to the instructions given by the [RetroGuard](https://github.com/FMG793/RetroGuard-Modded).

**Step 4**

Open provided by [RetroGuard](https://github.com/FMG793/RetroGuard-Modded) output jar in [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma).

**Step 5**

Apply [Enigma Mappings](Enigma_mappings_for_ext1605_20_client) to the opened in [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) jar.

**Step 6**

Save jar and decompiled code provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma).

**Step 7**

Decompile provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) output jar with [Fernflower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower).

**Step 8**

Run and setup [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) by choosing version alpha 1.1.2_01.

**Step 9**

Go to "conf" folder created by [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) in the folder where you set up [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).

**Step 10**

Open "client.tiny" in text editoe and delete all contents. (DO NOT delete the file)

**Step 11**

Go to "jars" folder created by [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) in the folder where you set up [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).

**Step 12**

Delete "minecraft.jar" and put the output jar provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) to the folder.

**Step 13**

Rename output jar provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) to "minecraft.jar".

**Step 14**

Decompile jar by [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).

**Step 15**

Open project in a java developer program of your preference.

**Step 16**

Go to "minecraft\src\net\minecraft\src" folder created by [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) in the folder where you set up [RetroMCP](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).

**Step 17**

Add missing files from decompiled code provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) to the "src" folder. (DO NOT replace existing files in "src" folder)

**Step 18**

Fix all errors in a project by using decompiled code provided by [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) and [Fernflower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower). (And your brain, of course)

**Done!**

You successfully decompile Cypress!
